## About Me

Welcome to my blog! I'm Ayush, an aspiring machine learning and robotics researcher. I created this blog to share my thoughts and experiences on machine learning, robotics, and other tech stuff that is pretty cool. I hope you enjoy reading my posts.  

Note: The image provided above is an AI generated image using Meta's new Llama 3. Keen to see how they improve over time, especially since there are open source now.

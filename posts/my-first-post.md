# Introduction post  

Let's get started with the blogging! This is going to be a short blog. Today I am going to talk about my profound hatred towards Microsoft. In my head I would like to describe my relationship with Microsoft similar to that of Linus Torvalds and Nvidia.  
And I think many of you will probably concur. From Teams frustrasting layouts, lags, random crashes and resource hog. And on top of all this, they do not provide ANY support to Linux users.  

This semester I had decided to put Ubuntu 22.04 on my laptop and daily drive it. I was curious see how dependent I was with windows. To my plesant surprise, not all! I didn't find myself telling "Oh I wish Ubuntu had this it made my life so much easier on windows". Apart from the requirement of using teams for one of courses this semster, the experience is great.  

If you ever thought of experimenting this, go ahead! I give this my thumb of approval.
